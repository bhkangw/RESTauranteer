## Synopsis
RESTauranteer is a web app that allows users to submit reviews for restaurants. Users can submit their reviews on restaurants as well as see the reviews placed by other people! Of course not limited to just restaurants - leave a review for that awful haircut you received last month! 

## Direct Goals
1. Using my skills to create a review collecter app.
2. Practicing object relational mapping with Entity.
3. Developing my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core.

## Features
- Form validations screen incoming data prior to entering database.
- Connects to MySQL database via Entity ORM.
- Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling.
- Secure connection strings using dependency injection.
